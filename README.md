### Hi, I'm Aaron ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Postdoc in the Akey Lab at Princeton University. I'm broadly interested in developing theoretical models and developing/using computational tools to understand the dynamics and effects of admixture and introgression. Currently, I'm studying the legacy of Neanderthal introgression in diverse human populations. 

During my Master's, I developed a tool - MgCod - that detects stop codon reassingments in prokaryotic sequences and annotates coding regions accordingly. The tool was designed with crAss-like phages in mind, which show differential stop codon usage in parts of their genomes.
